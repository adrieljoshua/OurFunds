# Project Documentation: DOAO - OurFunds

## Tagline
**"Empowering Communities Through Decentralized Treasury Management"**

## Project Overview
OurFunds is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed to manage community-driven treasuries. It enables organizations, DAOs, and online communities to pool funds transparently and allocate them through proposal-based governance.

Members contribute to a shared treasury using cryptocurrency and vote on funding proposals submitted by verified users. To prevent abuse, proposal submitters must stake an amount equal to or greater than the funds they request. If the community votes in favor, the funds are released. If the funds are misused and reported, a slashing mechanism returns the stake to the treasury.

The platform uses on-chain identity verification (via Self Protocol) and smart contracts to handle treasury logic, staking, voting, and fund disbursal.

## Key Features
- **On-chain treasury and staking system**
- **Proposal-based funding with community voting**
- **Slashing mechanism for fund misuse**
- **Verified identity and role-based permissions using Self Protocol**
- **GitHub & Discord integrations for transparency and collaboration**
- **Real-time dashboard of proposals, fund flow, and voting stats**
- **Modular structure for DAOs, NGOs, and grant committees**

## Use Cases
- Community grants
- Project funding within DAOs
- Hackathon bounties
- Mutual aid groups

OurFunds makes collective decision-making around money transparent, secure, and accountableâ€”without centralized intermediaries.
